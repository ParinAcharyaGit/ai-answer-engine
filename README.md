# AI Answer Engine
## Description
AI Answer Engine with Next.js and TypeScript that can scrape content from websites and mitigates hallucinations by citing its sources when providing answers. This project is inspired by Perplexity.ai, a company currently valued at over $9 Billion.

## Future iterations
- Build a comprehensive solution to extract content from any kind of URL or data source, such as YouTube videos, PDFs, CSV files, and images
- Generate visualizations from the data such as bar charts, line charts, histograms, etc.
- Implement a hierarchical web crawler that starts at a given URL and identifies all relevant links on the page (e.g., hyperlinks, embedded media links) and scrapes the content from those links as well
